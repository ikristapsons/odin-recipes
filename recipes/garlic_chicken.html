    <h2>A stir fry recipe I developed to satisfy a family of garlic lovers.</h2>
    <p>
      Easy and delicious comfort food at its finest. These lightly floured,
      boneless chicken breasts are pan fried in butter and oil until golden and
      crispy before being added to a mouth-watering garlic cream sauce.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
      <li>1 bunch green onions, chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into strips</li>
      <li>2 onions, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 cup sliced cabbage</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 cups sugar snap peas</li>
      <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat peanut oil in a wok or large skillet. When oil begins to smoke,
        quickly stir in 2 cloves minced garlic, ginger root, green onions and
        salt. Stir fry until onion becomes translucent, about 2 minutes. Add
        chicken and stir until opaque, about 3 minutes. Add remaining 4 cloves
        minced garlic and stir. Add sweet onions, cabbage, bell pepper, peas and
        1/2 cup of the broth/water and cover.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, mix the remaining 1/2 cup broth/water, soy sauce, sugar
        and cornstarch. Add sauce mixture to wok/skillet and stir until chicken
        and vegetables are coated with the thickened sauce. Serve immediately,
        over hot rice if desired.
